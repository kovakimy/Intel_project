# Object Tracking with Line Crossing and Area Intrusion Detection
This program uses an object detection deep learning model and a re-identification model to find and track the objects in a movie. Then, the program will track the trajectory of the objects and check if the objects cross the defined virtual lines or the objects are inside the defined areas.

In this repository was implemented detection, re-identification, tracking and rendering on video.

### Object Tracking and Line Crossing Demo

### Required DL Models to Run This Demo

The demo expects the following models in the Intermediate Representation (IR) format:

 * For person / pedestrian detection and re-identification
   * `pedestrian-detection-adas-0002`
   * `person-reidentification-retail-0031`

 * For face detection and re-identification 
   * `face-detection-adas-0001`
   * `face-reidentification-retail-0095`

You can download these models from OpenVINO [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo).
In the `models.lst` is the list of appropriate models for this demo that can be obtained via `Model downloader`.

## How to Run


### 0. Prerequisites
- **OpenVINO 2020.2**
  - If you haven't installed it, go to the OpenVINO web page and follow the [*Get Started*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/documentation/get-started) guide to do it.  


### 1. Install dependencies  
The demo depends on:
- some dependencies


### 2. Download DL models from OMZ
Use `Model Downloader` to download the required models and convert the downloaded model into OpenVINO IR models with `Model Converter`.  
``` sh
(Linux) python3 $INTEL_OPENVINO_DIR/deployment_tools/tools/model_downloader/downloader.py --list models.lst
(Win10) python "%INTEL_OPENVINO_DIR%\deployment_tools\tools\model_downloader\downloader.py" --list models.lst
```

### 3. Run the demo app

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/kovakimy/Intel_project.git
cd Intel_project
mkdir build
cd build
cmake "../Intel_project" //path to CMakeLists.txt
cmake â€”build
AreaInstrusionDetection.exe
```

## Demo Output  
The application draws the results on the screen.
